GIT Ignore CLI
==============
This tool provides a command line interface to manage git ignore patterns of the [github/gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore)

Before all
==========
The development of those features is grandly inspired by the [git-flow project](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
