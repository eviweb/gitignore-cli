GIT Ignore CLI
==============
This tool provides a command line interface to manage git ignore patterns of the [github/gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore)

Before all
----------
The development of those features is grandly inspired by the [git-flow project](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)

3.    run ``sudo make install``
This will create a symbolic link in your ``/usr/local/bin`` directory pointing to ``./git-ignore`` command

Uninstallation
